# Changelog

## Version 0.22.1
- feat: Support git references for package analysis
  - Supports both HTTPS and SSH git repository formats
  - Optional branch/tag/commit specification (e.g., git://https://github.com/user/repo:branch)
  - Automatic cloning, dependency resolution, and cleanup
  - Formats: git://https://github.com/user/repo or git://git@github.com:user/repo
- fix: package name resolving for types referenced via a package-reference ('package:some_package/some_entrypoint.dart)
- fix: private top level methods where treated as part of the public API (resulting in all types used there treated as part of the public API as well)
- fix: don't print color control sequences if no terminal is attached (e.g. when piping the output to a file)
- fix: carry over entry points of type aliases to the aliased type (especially important for private types)
- fix: naming of unary operators was wrong (unaryunary...)
- fix: handling of top level functions in the context of show / hide in exports
- fix: report type parameter change in a base class as new change kind instead of removal + addition of base classes
- fix: handling of relative package paths

## Version 0.22.0
- fix: Fixes an issue if we have to deal with two types with the same name
- feat: add support for @internal annotations
- fix: Narrowing return types (generics) should not be considered a breaking change
- feat: Report usages of non-exported interfaces in JSON

## Version 0.21.1
- fix: Fix analysis of pub cache packages

## Version 0.21.0
- chore: adapt to new analyzer API. This may break things
- feat: run pub get indirectly

## Version 0.20.3
- fix: unary and binary operators can have the same name and crashed dart_apitool

## Version 0.20.2
- feat: adds support for Dart workspaces

## Version 0.20.1
- fix: remove dependency overrides from the pubspec.yaml file of the package to analyze as those might point to relative paths that are not resolvable in the context of the package to analyze

## Version 0.20.0
- update analyzer's lower boundary to avoid the 'withNullability' required param (it is required on lower versions)

## Version 0.19.1
- fix JSON report to specify "major" as change type for breaking changes
- adapt pub ref mechanism to also support omitting the version (and using the latest version if no version has been specified)
- fix: locking upper version of analyzer and adding 'withNullability' param

## Version 0.19.0
- introduces `force-use-flutter` option for all commands to force dart_apitool to use the `flutter` command.
- extend type usage tracking and fix situations in which types that are used in @visibleForTesting contexts were detected as not exported
- fix: don't treat adding static elements (methods, fields) or consts to a required interface as breaking
- fix: changed default for `--check-sdk-version` from `on` to `off` as changing the SDK version can not lead to breaking existing consumer code

## Version 0.18.0
- add missing export to json output for `extract` command
- adds analysis of readability and writability of fields.
- fixes interface equality logic in the differ functionality to be less strict on library renaming (if the entry points are still the same)
- fix change compatibility check for `dynamic` and `Object?` parameters
- fix compatibility checks for return types of executables

## Version 0.17.0
- bump dart SDK requirements to >=3.0.0
- Search downloaded packages in entire .pub-cache hosted directory in case path naming changes
- adds information about the package versions and the version check result to the reports (console, json, markdown)

## Version 0.16.3
- adds more diff result reporting options (cli, json, markdown)
- fixes broken local packages refs

## Version 0.16.2
- fixes relative path handling in package config (leading to unresolvable types)

## Version 0.16.1
- fixes issues with pubspec_overrides.yaml that got published with a pub package

## Version 0.16.0
- simplify preparation of packages by replacing the directory structure copy operation with carrying over the package config (that contains the absolute paths to the original path references). Thanks to @mosuem and @jonasfj for this idea! This makes the `--include-path-dependencies` option obsolete. This option has no effect anymore and will be removed in a future version.

## Version 0.15.0
- Remove effect of `--dependency-check-mode` and add a deprecation warning (for why refer to https://github.com/bmw-tech/dart_apitool/issues/144)

## Version 0.14.1
- Fixes an issue with path dev-dependencies
- Fixes issues with isSealed handling (extracted JSON was wrong) thanks @hamsbrar

## Version 0.14.0
- improves change type detection for parameter type changes (widening types is now considered non-breaking)
- ignores enum constructors and elements marked with @override
- detects @sealed classes and doesn't consider them as required interfaces
- removes '[no]-merge-base-classes' option as this functionality is crucial now
- improved entry point tracking
- warning if a root level type is part of the public API but not exported
  - can be turned into an error with `--[no-]set-exit-on-missing-export`
- new option `--ignore-requiredness` to be less strict about interface changes (only advised for packages with controlled usage)

## Version 0.13.0
- fixes an issue with required interface detection on property and field usage
- default behavior of `--ignore-prerelease` is now `on`
- improved pre-release handling. Now dart_apitool plays well in scenarios where released pre-release versions are compared to the new stable release
- fall back to system Flutter executable if no matching Flutter executable can be found

## Version 0.12.1
- move package from devmil to bmw-tech ðŸš€

## Version 0.12.0
- extend handling of change types to include "breaking", "non-breaking-minor" and "non-breaking-patch" changes
- only output sub process output in a "window" if stdout is a terminal

## Version 0.11.1
- fixes parsing of local package references

## Version 0.11.0
- replaces `--check-versions` with `--version-check-mode`
- reduces the amount of directories to copy in a path-dependency-context
- prints sub process output
- `--remove-example` option (defaults to true) that deletes the "example" directory of the package to analyze (in the temporary directory) to avoid issues with the example project

## Version 0.10.2
- fixes an issue with cache location and Flutter 3.7.0

## Version 0.10.1 
- fixes an issue with projects having path dependencies to projects inside their folder structure

## Version 0.10.0
- adds include-path-dependencies parameters
- dependencies are ignored if one side of the diff is a path dependency

## Version 0.9.1
- use the relative path only for top level entities
- use a more stable way of getting the relative path

## Version 0.9.0
- Adds detection and consideration of @experimental flag
- Increases robustness regarding
  -  analysis_options: Those get now removed (in a temporary copy) to not limit the scope of dart_apitool
  -  Duplicate names: Detection of interfaces now considers the relative path of the library file to avoid crashes on duplicate names

## Version 0.8.0
- Improves handling of elements without root
- Changing required interfaces (even adding things) is now considered a breaking change
  interfaces are considered 'required' if they are abstract and used in a public method or field.
  This indicates that this interfaces is intended to be implemented by the user and therefore adding things also is breaking the API.
- Detect changes in package dependencies
- Adds codes for API diff reasons that point to an explanation [here](https://github.com/bmw-tech/dart_apitool/blob/main/readme/change_codes.md)

## Version 0.7.0
- *BREAKING*: renamed "Class" model elements to "Interface" to reflect the abstraction it represents
- Fixes Extension handling (are now treated as interfaces)
  
## Version 0.6.0
- *BREAKING*: removes capability to use stored models in diffs
- *BREAKING*: CommandMixin's "analyze" no longer does clean up preparation results. For this the newly introduced "cleanUp" method has to be called
- Fixes major issue with equal class names (or top-level variables, functions or type aliases) imported in different namespaces
- Improve diff tree output
- Analyzes and diffs platform constraints
- Analyzes and diffs SDK versions

## Version 0.5.1
- Fixes Analyzer problem when visiting elements multiple times

## Version 0.5.0
- PackageAPI semantics are now an enum
- Fixes issues with entry points for fields and executables (differ ignored them)
- API changes for the diff command are now printed as a proper tree

## Version 0.4.0
- adds type aliases to Package API model
- fixes missing entry points for root level fields and functions
- fixed typo in `PackageApiDiffResult`

## Version 0.3.2
- fixes base class merge (root level elements)

## Version 0.3.1
- fixes base class merge (override duplicates)

## Version 0.3.0
- *BREAKING*: by default base class elements get now merged with the derived class. This makes previously saved models incompatible.  
"dart_apitool" will detect that, but it is not possible to diff an old model with a new one. (can only happen if you saved the model, doesn't affect live analysis of pub or directory references).  
To deactivate that behavior you can use the `--no-merge-base-classes` option.
- fixes entry point handling
- fixes minimum version handling for versions with major == 0

## Version 0.2.1
- fixes getting own version in `pub global` context

## Version 0.2.0
- Command cleanup
- Calls `dart pub` or `flutter pub` depending on the package dependencies
- Refactor Dart and Pub Interaction helpers
- Entry points are now analyzed and diffed as well (List of publicly available import destinations that this element can be reached with)

## Version 0.1.2
- Adds `--ignore-prerelease` to diff command

## Version 0.1.1
- Fixes pre-release handling (old version was checked)

## Version 0.1.0
- Fixes pre-release handling: in case of a pre-release version there is no differentiation between breaking and non-breaking changes
- Fixes some issues with the analyzer and pub package references
- loosened strictness on pre-release versions

## Version 0.0.1-dev.1
- Initial version
