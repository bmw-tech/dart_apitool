# Dart API Tool

A tool to analyze the public API of a package and create a model of it.
It also allows to use that model to compare the public API with a newer version and check if the version follows [semver](https://semver.org) correctly.

[![CI](https://github.com/bmw-tech/dart_apitool/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/bmw-tech/dart_apitool/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/dart_apitool.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_apitool)

                                         You may want to do this if you want to make sure
                                         (in your CI) that the version - once ready - matches semver.

## Integration

How to best integrate `dart-apitool` in your CI and release process highly depends on your setup.

In general, you need to have a reference of what has been released before in order to do a diff to the new sources.

To do that you can either:
- store the last released version next to your source code (via a separate file or by using tags)
- or use whatever knowledge your release process has to get a copy of the previously released version

Depending on what you have as a reference you can call `dart-apitool` using the appropriate package ref for the `old` parameter:
1. pub://[package_name]/[package-version] if you know the last released version and your package is hosted at pub
2. [path-to-copy] to get the public API model from the obtained reference copy

### CI

For an example how to integrate `dart-apitool` in your CI (to make sure that the current pre-release version is targeting the right version number) you can refer to the [workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml#L77) used by this repository.
`dart-apitool` uses approach 1 (use the tags to determine the last released version). It uses `git describe` to get the last tag and then uses the tag as the version for the `pub://` reference.
```shell
tag=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
version="${tag#releases/}" # to support the old tag format dart_apitool used (e.g. releases/0.12.0)
version="${version#v}" # the new tag format (e.g. v0.12.0)
```
You can see this in action in the [workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) of this repository. 

For your convenience there is a reusable workflow that you can integrate in your workflow.
```yml
  semver:
    uses: bmw-tech/dart_apitool/.github/workflows/check_version.yml@workflow/v1
    with:
      runs-on: [your build node] # defaults to ubuntu-latest
      old: [package ref to old] # required, e.g. "pub://dart_apitool/<old version>"
      new: [package ref to new] # e.g. "."
      ignore-prerelease: ['on' if you want to check against the future version (without pre-release), defaults to 'off'] # e.g. 'on'
      flutter-channel: [flutter channel to use, defaults to 'stable'] # e.g. 'stable'
      flutter-version: [flutter version to use, defaults to 'any'] # e.g. 'any'
```

### Release

Your release process has to make sure that the reference is stored somehow. The easiest way to do that is to use git tags for this. You probably are creating tags for releases anyway so using them to get the last released version is a good idea. 
The release process can also use `dart-apitool` to make sure that the new version matches the changes it contains.

## Contributions
Any kind of contribution is very welcome. 
Either you have found a false positive or you miss something in the public API model that needs to be analyzed or if you want to contribute directly.
Feel free to use the [issues](https://github.com/bmw-tech/dart_apitool/issues) to create requests.

## Limitations
It doesn't cover all potential API changes that might lead to breaking changes.

### It does not look into implementations
Imagine a class:
```dart
class MyClass<T> {
  String doSomething(T arg) {
    final castedArg = arg as SomeBaseClass;
    return castedArg.baseClassMethod();
  }
}
```
that got changed to
```dart
class MyClass<T> {
  String doSomething(T arg) {
    final castedArg = arg as SomeOtherBaseClass;
    return castedArg.otherBaseClassMethod();
  }
}
```
Changes in the implementation are not detected.

### Verdict

You have to keep your eyes ðŸ‘€ open and always remember the public API! 

`dart-apitool` can help you find problematic changes on Dart API level, but it can't detect everything. ðŸ˜‰
